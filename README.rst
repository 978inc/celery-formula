.. note::

    See the full `Salt Formulas installation and usage instructions
    <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html>`_.


Available states
==================

.. contents::
   :local:

``celery``
------------
Installs celery library and commands

``celery.worker``
------------------
Creates a systemd service for running Celery Workers

`celery.worker_queues` is a list of maps which contain four keys: `name`, `concurrency` and `opts`.
- `name` controls the name of the queue
- `concurrency` controls how many worker processes per queue
- `opts` is a map where the keys are mapped to `CELERYD_` environment variables 

``celery.debug``
-----------------
Helpful for debugging, dumps the jinja map to a text file



Testing
=========

Requirements
------------

Testing is done with KitchenSalt_ which means you'll also need a working Ruby setup and preferably 2.2.2, but you can use whatever version as long as you update the `Gemfile`.  You will also need `bundler` installed and can be done so with `gem install bundler`.

If all that works, you should be able to run `kitchen test` which is an alias for `kitchen converge` + `kitchen verify` but it deletes the box on completion so it isn't very useful during development.

Cheat Sheet
------------

.. code-block::

   # Initial setup
   which bundle || gem install bundler
   bundle install
   
   # build vagrant box and run states
   kitchen converge
   
   # run tests in `test/integration/default`
   kitchen verify

   # sledgehammer
   kitchen destroy

   # alias for running  (destroy + converge + verify + destroy)
   kitchen test
